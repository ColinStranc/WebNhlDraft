## attribute-cell todo ##
- handle missing information more gracefully and universally (if anything is missing give all '-' text)
- styles
    - colours (variable-ized would be great)
    - space between rating and percentile
    - name left-aligned to start of rating?
    - do I really want to represent percentile type by color?
    - make component consistent height?
- split compact styling and non-compact styling
- capability to swap percentile filters
- use long and short name for attribute (really make it an object)
- how are we getting the attribute info?

## player-card todo ##
- styles
    - well, lots still...
- lots of other stuff too.
- Preview row stacks things horizontally
- add full detail attribute section, and the more link to make it appear

## percentile calculations ##
- ascending vs. descending comparisons (aka overall vs. salary)
- get data from actual data place
- deal with the skater/goalie stat split
