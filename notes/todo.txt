## attribute-cell todo ##
- handle missing information more gracefully and universally (if anything is missing give all '-' text)
    - if attribute id is invalid, things should '-' gracefully.
- styles
    - colours (variable-ized would be great)
    - space between rating and percentile
    - name left-aligned to start of rating?
    - do I really want to represent percentile type by color?
    - make component consistent height?
    - lots of work for non-compact styling
        - width of name.

## player-card todo ##
- styles
    - well, lots still...
    - handedness and position seperated properly
    - make last name bigger/bolder
    - section seperators more appropriate.
    - manage the space between attribute-cells
    - fix the added gap in the top row when full details shows up
    - preview row text should not overlap the border
    - align more-details attribute-cells better (on the overall perhaps?) This should probably wait till the attribute-cell long form themselves are given a good do-over.
- custom attributes section in full-details
- notes section in full-details
- full details can take ~three times the width of normal cell
- team color should truly try to find actual owning team color.
- show all stats in full-details

## percentile calculations ##
- ascending vs. descending comparisons (aka overall vs. salary)
- deal with the skater/goalie stat split

## data provider ##
- computed stats
- transactions
