- handle missing information more gracefully and universally (if anything is missing give all '-' text)
- styles
    - colours (variable-ized would be great)
    - space between rating and percentile
    - name left-aligned to start of rating?
- split compact styling and non-compact styling
- capability to swap percentile filters
- remove percentile logic to a window variable (or find some better way to do it...)
